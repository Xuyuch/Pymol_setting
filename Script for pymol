Script for pymol broad->rotate->transfer->merge->rotate
1 Get the exp.py file and copy it to /pymol/pymol_mive_exp.py(step for broad and rotate)
2 Modify the new exp.py based on a_exp.rotate.py
	a. remenber to get_view during the process
3 Run the script linear_change.py(transfer the chromosome from A cell to B cell)

	b Remember set the save file_path
5 Open the saved file_path in step 3 use the code below to genrate a mp4 file.
	Code:ffmpeg -framerate 5 -i ./frame_%03d.png -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x720 -b:v 5162k test.mp4
6 Do step 5 again for result in step4
7 get a list.txt which includes 3 mp4 file
	list file sample
	file 'rotate_pro.mp4'
	file 'test.mp4'
	file 'back_to_ball.mp4'
8 Run the code below to genrate the final video
